CollaboApp Bootstrap Theme
========

The CollaboApp theme is a Bootstrap responsive template made to showcase your newest app or service with plan pricing and signup.  The Bootstrap core is completely in tact so upgrades are easy and customization is a simple.  Use LESS?  We have you covered, all the less files are modular and can be easily edited and re-compiled.  Don't use LESS?  No problem, the bootstrap CSS is ready for you to use out of the box and the custom collaboapp.css file is compiled directly so you can just edit it like normal CSS if you like.
